Todo items ("MVP"):
- [x] Fix whatever I broke that's casuing no previous object errors to appear or investigate file to determine if its real.
- [x] Drill into the iteration logic for segments and nail it down, handle early return for malformed segments (DONE)
- [x] interleaved data (new test file needed)
- [x] interleaved read setup
- [x] interleaved data presentation (read_vector update) 
- [x] common function for read development
- [x] Implement TypeVector for bool
- [x] Implement TypeVector for Boolean
- [x] Implement TypeVector for TdmsString
- [x] Implement TypeVector for TimeStamp
- [x] Understand how strings actually interleave, is length at the start of every byte block? (new test file needed)
- [x] understand and verify chunk size handling for channels which are added (new test file needed) (DONE)
- [x] separate out algorithm concerns into functions, i.e. update index step (WONT DO)
- [x] Handle DAQmx data types (DONE)
- [x] Test cases/files for each data type (specifically need to verify things like time stamps)
- [x] Read data vector is overloaded, the entry gates and object finding stuff shouldn't live there.
- [ ] General tidy up of compiler warnings, module imports/organsation etc

Future state:
- [ ] Workspace or otherwise separate app from library code
- [ ] Smart sub-sampling for speed (based on window size in pixels?)
- [x] Box zoom (developed by nongiach)
- [ ] Legend
- [ ] Axes labels
- [ ] Time series support
- [ ] Pretty up the channel interface (tick box to activate channels?)
- [ ] Remove previous channel on load (or hold multiple files)
- [ ] Speed comparison against Speedo
- [x] Tidy up useless accumulating objects variable
- [ ] Implement TypeVector for FixedPoint
- [ ] Implement TypeVector for ComplexSingleFloat
- [ ] Implement TypeVector for ComplexDoubleFloat
- [ ] Implement TypeVector for DAQmxRawData
- [ ] Implement TypeVector for ExtendedFloat
- [ ] Test case for flexlogger
